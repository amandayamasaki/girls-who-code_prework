Girls Who Code / DePaul University pre-work for the iOS app development course in Swift for summer 2018. 

## Course Overview ##
In this course students will use the Swift programming language and Appleâ€™s XCode development environment to design and build their own iPhone or iPad apps. In Week 1 they will learn the fundamentals of Swift and XCode by working on small projects that are designed to teach them how to design and program core features and functionality of popular mobile apps like: navigating multiple screens; accepting user input through buttons and text fields; displaying data in tables; and using the camera to take and display images. In Week 2, students will develop their teamwork and leadership skills while applying the learnings from Week 1 to design, build, and present an iPhone or iPad app that solves a social problem or that reflects their interests. At the end of the program they will have built a portfolio of Swift projects and iOS apps!
